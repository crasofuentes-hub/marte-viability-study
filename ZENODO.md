# Zenodo Archive Notes

This repository is archived on Zenodo as software.

## Scope
This project provides a **strict, non-speculative baseline model** for evaluating
Mars colony viability with respect to:
- Oxygen mass balance
- Water mass balance
- Radiation dose bookkeeping (no clinical conversion)

All numeric parameters are derived exclusively from **verifiable primary sources**
(NASA / ESA technical reports, NTRS, or peer-reviewed literature).

## Non-Claims
This archive does NOT claim:
- Long-term sustainability of a Mars colony
- Acceptable radiation risk thresholds
- Feasibility of terraforming
- Closed-loop agriculture or food independence
- Multi-generational human viability at 0.38 g

See docs/NON_CLAIMS.md.
