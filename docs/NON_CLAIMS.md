# Non-Claims (Strict Baseline)

This repository is intentionally conservative and does **not** make claims that are not defensible from primary sources.

## This repo does NOT claim
- That a sustainable Mars colony is achievable within any specific timeline.
- That any particular launch system cost/kg is real or stable.
- That fertility or healthy multi-generational reproduction is feasible at 0.38g.
- That radiation risk is "acceptable" or "unacceptable" (no clinical conversion here).
- That ISRU can be scaled reliably without long-duration demonstrated data.
- That agriculture/food closure is solved.

## What this repo DOES claim
- If you provide explicit initial stores and verified per-capita consumables, the model can compute the **time-to-depletion** under a defined resupply schedule and closure fractions.
- Radiation dose can be tracked as a transparent bookkeeping variable using published dose-equivalent rates.

## Why this matters
Most "Mars colonization" discussions fail due to hidden assumptions.
This repository is designed to surface assumptions, not bury them.
