# Non-Claims (Strict Baseline)

This repository does **not** make claims that cannot be supported by primary sources.

## This repo does NOT claim
- That a sustainable Mars colony is achievable within any specific timeline.
- That fertility or healthy multi-generational reproduction is feasible at 0.38g.
- That radiation risk is acceptable/unacceptable (no clinical conversion here).
- That ISRU can be scaled reliably without long-duration demonstrated data.
- That food closure is solved.
- That terraforming is feasible or desirable.

## This repo DOES provide
- Transparent depletion-time computation for O₂ and water under explicit inputs.
- Radiation dose bookkeeping using published cruise vs surface rates.
- A reproducible, auditable workflow (tests + CI) designed to prevent hidden assumptions.

## Why this stance is intentional
Most "Mars colonization" narratives fail due to untracked assumptions.
This repo is designed to surface assumptions, quantify constraints, and remain falsifiable.
