## Title
Mathematical and Physical Analysis of Mars Colony Viability Under Verified Constraints: A Strict Baseline

## Authors
Recycling World

## Abstract
(TODO) Summarize the strict baseline: verified anchors only, depletion-time computation for O₂ and water with discrete resupply and closure fractions; radiation dose bookkeeping without clinical conversion.

## 1. Introduction
(TODO) Context, scope control, reproducibility.

## 2. Methods
- Verified parameter policy
- Conservation-law consumables model
- Collapse criterion
- Radiation bookkeeping

## 3. Results (baseline demonstrations)
(TODO) Include only results driven by explicit inputs and verified anchors. Provide reproducible commands and generated figures.

## 4. Discussion
Interpretation boundaries and required future verification for food, fertility, ISRU reliability, and psychosocial dynamics.

## 5. Limitations
See docs/NON_CLAIMS.md.
