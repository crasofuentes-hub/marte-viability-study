## Title
Mathematical and Physical Analysis of Mars Colony Viability Under Verified Constraints: A Strict Baseline

## Authors
Recycling World

## Abstract
(TODO) Summarize the strict baseline: verified constants only, depletion-time computation for O₂ and water with discrete resupply and closure fractions; radiation dose bookkeeping without clinical conversion.

## 1. Introduction
(TODO) Motivation, scientific scope control, reproducibility.

## 2. Methods
- Verified parameter policy
- Conservation-law consumables model
- Collapse criterion
- Radiation bookkeeping

## 3. Results (baseline demonstrations)
(TODO) Include only results driven by inputs and verified constants; provide reproducible command lines and figures generated by the repo.

## 4. Discussion
- Interpretation boundaries
- What must be verified before expanding scope (food, fertility, ISRU reliability, etc.)

## 5. Limitations
Reference docs/NON_CLAIMS.md.
